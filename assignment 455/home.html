                <h2>Adopting Pets</h2>
                <p>Buying a pet is not cheap. Prices range from $500 to $1,000 or more! And that does not include the cost of spay/neuter, first vaccinations or microchipping. Adoption fees rarely break $200 and often include all those post-adoption amenities. A bargain when you consider you’ll be bringing home the companion of a lifetime!

                <h2>Training can be easier</h2>
                <p>While some shelter animals come in as strays, many end up there because of human problems like a move or divorce, not because the animal wasn’t a good pet. Many are already house-trained and used to living with families, so training comes more naturally.</p>

                <h2>Supporting System</h2>
                <p>When you get a dog from a pet store, the transaction usually ends once you exit the door. Many pet stores don’t have the resources or knowledge to provide any support if you have questions or problems with your new pet.</p>
